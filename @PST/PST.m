classdef PST
  % 
  %PST A static class containing functions based on PST (Power System 
  %  Toolbox by J.H. Chow). These are the PST functions from PSTOLD
  %  related to power system computation tasks (Ybus, loadflow etc).
  %  
  % This class was created to host several MODIFIED PST functions with 
  % IMPROVED functionality (YYbus, LLoadflow) (mainly better  handling
  % of phase shifters). Then it was augmented with unchanged copies of  
  % other used PST functions to keep things together.
  %
  % The class copies/reproduces some key functionalities of PSTOLD (the
  % first version of PST written by J.H. Chow) and is focused on generator
  % coherency and aggregation. The later augmentations by G. Rogers (pstv3,
  % pstdat, statespace) are not in this class. 
  % 
  % However, savepst() and loadpst() and some others can be used with 
  % pstv3 as well.
